                    with the highest number of restaurants, followed closely by 
                    Bangkok and London. Cities like Tokyo, New York, and Mexico 
                    City have a moderate representation with around 4-5 restaurants. 
                    The chart displays a typical long-tail distribution, where a few 
                    cities have many restaurants. As we move down the chart, the 
                    number of restaurants per city decreases, with a vast majority 
                    having only one.
                    <br><br>
                    The waffle chart shows Europe is the dominant region with 45% of 
                    the restaurants on the list, reflecting its strong culinary 
                    heritage and diverse gastronomic offerings. Asia follows with 27%. 
                    South America and North America account for 13% and 12%, 
                    respectively, while Africa has the least representation with only 2%. 
                    This distribution underscores Europe and Asia's prominence in the 
                    culinary world while highlighting opportunities for growth and 
                    recognition in continents like Africa.</div>

                    A tasting menu is a collection of several dishes in small portions,
                     served in a single meal. It is designed to showcase the chef's 
                     skills and creativity, offering a journey through various flavors, 
                     culinary styles, and techniques. Diners experience a sequence of 
                     courses, often with the option of wine pairing, where each beverage 
                     complements the flavors of the dishes. The tasting menu aims to 
                     provide a comprehensive and immersive dining experience, exploring
                      the chef's signature offerings and gastronomic vision.
                    <br><br>
                    The majority of the restaurants have tasting menu 
                    prices ranging between 150 to 550 AUD. 
                    Only a few outliers have prices above or below this range. 
                    There isn't a strong direct correlation between rank and price. 
                    In conclusion, while rank might influence the tasting menu's price 
                    to some extent, other factors likely play a significant role in 
                    pricing decisions.

                    restaurants offering outstanding cooking. 
                    They take into account five universal criteria:
                     the quality of the ingredients, the harmony 
                     of flavours, the mastery of techniques, the 
                     personality of the chef as expressed through 
                     their cuisine and, just as importantly, consistency
                      both across the entire menu and over time.
